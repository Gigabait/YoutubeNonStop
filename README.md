# YoutubeNonStop
Autoclicker for Youtube's latest "feature" - Video paused. Continue watching?

**Works only if the YouTube tab is visible (so, unfortunately, it doesn't work if YouTube is minimized... at least not yet)**

It is developed based on the assumption that if we get a popup but we haven't interacted with YouTube for the past 3 seconds, it's the "Continue watching?" confirmation.
